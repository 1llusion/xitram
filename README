Xitram is an experimental programming language, that aims to be as simple as possible, so even people without programming knowledge can learn it within minutes.
Additionally, the syntax can be edited very easily by creating new PHP classes.

To add a new keyword:
=> Create a new file [your keyword].php in the folder "interpreter/keywords"
=> Include a class: class [your keyword] implements keywords{}
=> Define these functions in the class: 
	public function error(){ //This function returns any errors
	}

	public function syntax($string){ //This function is called to test the syntax
	}
	public function run($string){ //This function will be called, when the keyword is found	
	}
=> View the h.php file for an example
